<h2>HTML and CSS basics</h2>
This is a compilation of various HTML and CSS assignments that I completed for the Basic HTML and CSS course for The Tech Academy. These showcase some of the fundamentals that I learned while working through this course and are a stepping stone toward the bigger and better things that can be seen in my HTML and CSS Projects repository.
